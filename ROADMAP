✅ Updated Content Engine Roadmap (2025 Edition)

(Clean, structured, and aligned with the modular architecture we just agreed on.)

🟢 Completed

 First-pass UI overhaul (header, sidebar, layout reflow)

 Versions timeline with score/model/metadata

 Quality pill colouring (green ≥90%, amber 75–90%, red <75)

 Basic source ingestion (URLs + pasted text)

 Statement analysis (atomic statements, reliability scoring, category tagging)

 Ask-AI module (with session history, disabling button after click)

 Collapsible sections (Future Roadmap, Statement Analysis, Ask-AI)

 Vercel backend v2 with robust CORS and error handling

 Style guide improvements (no thousand separators for years, normal English commas)

 Drafting workflow fully stable

🚧 In Progress Now
Phase 1 — Frontend Migration to Modular Architecture

 Introduce new folder structure (modules/, components/, hooks/, utils/ingest)

 Split the monolithic App.jsx into:

 UI primitives (Button, Input, Card, TextArea, Pill)

 Layout components (TwoColumn, MainColumn, SideColumn, Header)

 Drafting module panels (Draft Output, Sources, Output Types, Generation Controls)

 Statement Analysis panel

 Ask-AI panel

 Versions Timeline

 History Sidebar

 Add core hooks (useDraftState, useApi, useToggle)

 Preserve all existing behaviour exactly while modularizing

 Prepare structure for future modules (reviewing, export, ingestion)

🟡 Next Up (Near-Term, high priority)

These are features tightly tied to the new architecture that should follow immediately after migration.

A. Advanced Source Ingestion (PDF/DOC/XLSX/PPTX)

 Add SourceIngestion panel with file-drop + browse uploader

 Support ingestion types:

 PDF → text extraction + page-level metadata

 DOCX → using docx parser

 XLSX → cell/column extraction

 PPTX → slide text extraction

 Add backend endpoints (/api/ingest, /api/extract-pdf, etc.)

 Add UI preview + confirmation before adding to Sources table

 Add progress indicators + error fallback

 Store extracted text as structured Source objects:

{
  id,
  type,
  name,
  text,
  metadata: { pages, mime, sizeKB }
}

B. Project Metadata Panel

 New panel for:

 Investment name

 Transaction date

 Reference texts (style/substance guide)

 Auto-inject metadata into /generate and /rewrite prompts

 Display metadata within the UI top bar or sidebar

C. Auto-Analysis & Auto-Run Logic

 Automatically run statement analysis after every Generate/Rewrite

 Auto-update version metadata

 New toggle: “Auto-run analysis”

🔵 Medium-Term (Major Features)
D. Export System (multi-format bundler)

A full export module allowing the user to select which elements to export:

 Draft text

 Source table (URLs uploaded files, extracted metadata)

 Statement reliability table

 Ask-AI Q&A log

 Model settings

 Metadata (investment name, transaction date, reference texts)

Supported output formats:

 PDF export pack

 DOCX report

 HTML export

 JSON archive

 ZIP bundle containing multiple exports

Selectable, e.g.:

☑ Draft text
☑ Reliability table
☐ Ask AI
☑ Sources
Export as: PDF / DOCX / ZIP / JSON

Everything pulls cleanly from modular components.

🔴 Longer-Term (Major Modules & Intelligence Upgrades)
E. Reviewing Module

A second standalone workflow in the app:

Review Mode Steps:

Upload draft text

Upload sources (PDF/URLs/DOCX/text)

Run evaluation:

correctness vs sources

reliability statements

drafting style vs reference texts

Receive revision suggestions:

contradicting statements

unclear logic

weak evidence

style inconsistencies

Auto-rewrite options

Export review report (ties into Export System)

This will reuse:

Statement analysis

Source ingestion

Style guide rules

Ask-AI Q&A

Versions timeline

Architecture:
src/modules/reviewing/
    ReviewInput.jsx
    ReviewSources.jsx
    ReviewAnalysis.jsx
    ReviewSuggestions.jsx

🔮 Future R&D Items (not urgent, but valuable)

Live collaboration mode (multi-user projects)

In-app PDF viewer with highlight → extract → send to model

Style guide builder UI

Model benchmarking viewer

On-device caching for low-latency rewriting

“Assistant personas” that alter the prompting style (professional, concise, aggressive editing, etc.)
