# Content Engine – Product Roadmap
_Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD_

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of the Content Engine from the current MVP toward a production-grade, enterprise-deployable platform. It integrates all architecture, UX, feature, and future-capability discussions to date.

---

# 1. 🎯 Vision & Objectives

The Content Engine enables users to:
- Upload or provide sources (documents, pasted text, URLs)
- Generate structured investment-grade written outputs
- Apply defined style guides and scenario rules
- Produce public-facing vs complete/internal versions
- Iterate via rewrite instructions
- Track version history with metadata and scoring
- Provide transparency through source auditability and statement reliability

Future goals:
- Real public-domain retrieval
- Internal knowledge-base ingestion
- Document similarity checks
- Multi-client style guide switching
- Enterprise-grade privacy, access control, and SSO
- Automated templated Word/PPT outputs

---

# 2. ⭐ Completed (MVP Foundations)

### 2.1 Core Features
- Upload & parse text, files, and URLs
- Scenario-based prompt templates
- Complete vs Public-facing drafting
- Inline style guide compliance
- Version generation and rewrite
- Token, temperature, model selection

### 2.2 UI/UX
- Full UI overhaul (2025)
- Cleaner layout and spacing
- Collapsible advanced settings
- Color-coded metadata pills
- Consistent controls + button hierarchy
- Sources table (user-provided)

### 2.3 Reliability & Debugging
- CORS overhaul & correct headers
- Backend restructuring and cleanup
- Removal of circular imports
- Safe JSON parsing
- Stable scoring engine
- Error toasts with safe truncation

---

# 3. 🛠 In Progress (Actively Being Implemented)

### 3.1 Statement Reliability (Beta)
- New backend endpoint `/api/analyse-statements`
- Break draft into atomic statements
- Reliability scoring (0–100%)
- Classification:
  - Source-based factual
  - Plausible factual
  - Interpretive/subjective
  - Speculative/forward-looking
- Flags for risks (e.g., “not supported by source”)
- UI table under Draft card

### 3.2 Style Guide Consolidation
- One location only: `DEFAULT_STYLE_GUIDE`
- Rules for:
  - Numbers (“one”–“eleven”, ranges, units)
  - No em-dashes
  - Institutional tone
  - Currency handling
  - Paragraph structure
- Removal of duplicated rules from prompts

### 3.3 Source Snapshot Per Version
- Every generated/rewrite version stores:
  - File names, size
  - URLs
  - Text-length metrics
- Displayed in Sources table

---

# 4. 🧩 Next Up (Short-Term Roadmap)

### 4.1 Full Public-Source Retrieval (Real Web Context)
(Currently, public search = “allow model knowledge”. Next version = real retrieval.)

#### Backend
- `/api/public-search` endpoint
- Connect to a real web search service (Google Custom Search, Bing Search, Tavily, Perplexity, etc.)
- Extract canonical URLs, titles, snippets
- Provide structured `publicSources` list
- Prevent hallucinated URLs

#### Frontend
- Merge `userProvidedSources` + `publicSources`
- Expanded Sources table:
  - File / URL / Text / Public Web Source
- Optional: relevance ranking

---

### 4.2 Rewrite Consistency Improvements
- Allow version-type switching mid-version
- Preview changes before committing rewrite
- Rewrite-specific word limit override (optional)

---

### 4.3 Source Management UX
- “Remove source” (X button) for uploaded files & URLs
- “Preview source” inspector pane
- Show count of total uploaded sources
- Confirmation dialogs before removing big files

---

### 4.4 Prompt Audit Mode (Light)
- Show “effective prompt” for transparency
- User toggle: display prompt or hide
- Stripped of internal logic (safe mode)

---

# 5. 🧱 Medium-Term Roadmap (Beta → Full Product)

### 5.1 Reliability Dashboard
- Highlight low-reliability statements
- Inline highlighting in draft text
- Heatmap mode (color-coded reliability)
- Suggested fixes (“Rewrite this section?”)

### 5.2 Output Comparison Tools
- Compare two versions:
  - Diff view
  - Highlighted additions & removals
  - Score changes (clarity, tone, structure)

### 5.3 Multi-Output Bundles
- Generate several deliverables at once:
  - Press release
  - Portfolio commentary
  - Investor email
- Cross-coherence enforcement

### 5.4 Templated Word/PPT Output
- Word template engine (docx)
- PPT slides with:
  - Summary bullets
  - Charts (later)
- User-defined templates per client/team

### 5.5 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- View-only roles
- Editor roles
- Admin roles
- Audit logs (enterprise)

---

# 6. 🧠 Long-Term (Enterprise / v3+)

### 6.1 Internal Knowledge Base Integration
- Let users upload approved content to a private datastore
- ChromaDB / Pinecone / pgvector / Azure Search
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mode
- “Approve this version for training” workflow
- Optional: auto-tagging & metadata extraction

### 6.2 Data Governance & Compliance
- Automatic detection of sensitive content
- Blocked phrases awareness
- Client-specific redaction rules
- Multi-region data residency (EU/US/APAC)

### 6.3 Enterprise Integrations
- SSO (Okta / Azure AD / Google)
- Slack/Teams notifications (“Your draft is ready”)
- Export to internal content systems
- Integration with deal workflow tools (DealCloud, Salesforce, etc.)

---

# 7. 🧪 Experimental / Optional

- Citation-level accuracy scoring
- Boolean fact checking (“True / False / Needs evidence”)
- Style drift detection against historical outputs
- Sentiment analysis of tone
- Auto-created outline before drafting

---

# 8. 📦 Release Versioning Framework

### Version tags
- `v1.x.x`  → early prototypes  
- `v2.x.x`  → MVP stable  
- `v3.x.x`  → Beta with auditability  
- `v4.x.x`  → Enterprise-grade  

### Recommended workflow
1. Create a GitHub **release** after major feature sets  
2. Tag using semantic versioning  
3. Update `ROADMAP.md` + `CHANGELOG.md`  
4. Push to Vercel  
5. Keep main branch always deployable
